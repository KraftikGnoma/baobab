! Repetitive work steps
In the most projects, some work steps are done over and over again. To save time and prevent errors, occuring by doing these steps repetitively, baobab tries to automate them.

Automated work steps supported by baobab are called actions. An action is PowerShell script, that can be triggered inside the context of a project. Actions often depend on some preconditions like existing files or folders in the project and are therefore bundeled inside of [project aspects|aspects].

A list with all actions included in baobab can be found [here|action reference].
