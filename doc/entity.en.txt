! File-system-based entity
To manage data structures and resources in the file system, the concept of an entity is used. An entity is a folder, annotated with metadata and included resources. An entity folder has the following structure:

* _Entity folder_
** .entity
*** entity.xml
*** _Included resource files_
** _Entity data_

Hint: On a Windows operating system, the folder _.entity_ should have the hidden attribute. On UNIX-like operating systems, the prefixed period tells the operating system that the folder is hidden.

An entity usally has a specific type, which defines the semantics of the entity. One entity type is _project_ which is the main entity type implemented by baobab.

!! Metadata folder _.entity_
The hidden _.entity_ folder is the place to store metadata about the entity and additional resources required by the entity. It can contain sub folders for certain kinds of resources.

!! Metadata file _entity.xml_
The metadata file _entity.xml_ contains at least a GUID, identifying the entity, the entity type, and a name for the entity. Further it contain some specific metadata for the entity type.
